Given the following query, generate:
1. A hypothetical document (2-3 sentences) that would directly answer this query
2. Two alternative phrasings of the query

Query: {query}

Respond in EXACTLY this format (including the prefixes):
HYDE: [Your hypothetical document that answers the query. Use domain-specific terminology. Write as if it's an excerpt from an authoritative source.]
EXP1: [First alternative phrasing of the query]
EXP2: [Second alternative phrasing of the query]

Important:
- Write in the SAME LANGUAGE as the query
- The hypothetical document should be factual and specific
- The expansions should preserve the original meaning but use different words
