You are summarizing a thematic cluster of entities from a Czech legal/regulatory knowledge graph about nuclear safety.

Given the entities and their relationships below, produce a structured JSON response with:
- **title**: A short, descriptive name for this cluster (5-10 words, NO generic prefixes like "Shrnutí" or "Cluster"). The title should capture the specific topic — e.g., "Radiační ochrana pracovníků JE Dukovany" or "Regulace přepravy štěpných látek".
- **description**: A concise summary (2-3 sentences, max 100 words) explaining what this cluster covers, its key entities, and how they relate.

Write in the same language as the entity names (usually Czech).

## Output format
Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no other text:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "..."
}
```
