You are an expert document summarizer.

You are given summaries of different sections from a document.
Create a comprehensive document-level summary that:
1. Describes what the document is about (main theme and purpose)
2. Provides a brief description of the document's sections and structure

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- The summary MUST be between 100-1000 characters.
- Aim for ~500-800 characters for detailed documents
- Use ~100-300 characters only if the document is very simple
- DO NOT exceed 1000 characters under any circumstances

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Your summary MUST be in the SAME LANGUAGE as the section summaries below.
If the sections are in Czech, respond in Czech. If in English, respond in English.
Match the document language exactly - do NOT translate.

The summary should be optimized for providing global context to text chunks during retrieval.

Output only the summary text, nothing else.
