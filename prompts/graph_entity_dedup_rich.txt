You are reviewing potential duplicate entities in a knowledge graph.
Determine if these two entities refer to the SAME real-world thing (person, organization, regulation, concept, facility, etc.).

**Cosine similarity: {similarity:.3f}**

## Entity 1: {name1} (type: {type1})
Description: {desc1}
{rels1}

## Entity 2: {name2} (type: {type2})
Description: {desc2}
{rels2}

Rules:
- Abbreviations and full names of the same entity ARE duplicates (e.g., "SUJB" = "Statni urad pro jadernou bezpecnost", "IAEA" = "International Atomic Energy Agency").
- Name variants with/without qualifiers ARE duplicates if they refer to the same thing.
- Case-only differences ARE duplicates.
- Different numbered regulations are NOT duplicates (e.g., "regulation 307/2002" != "regulation 308/2002").
- Different amendments of the same regulation ARE duplicates if they refer to the same base regulation.
- Entities with the same name but fundamentally different types are NOT duplicates.
- General vs specific references to the same thing ARE duplicates.
- A core concept and its qualified variant ARE duplicates — keep the shorter, canonical name.
- Morphological variants (different grammatical forms of the same word) ARE duplicates.
- An AMENDMENT entity and its source REGULATION are NOT duplicates.
- DEFINITION entities with the same defined term from the same regulation ARE duplicates.
- If page images are provided, examine them to understand the context in which each entity appears. This can help disambiguate entities with similar names but different meanings.
