- Name variants with/without qualifiers ARE duplicates if same thing
- Case-only differences ARE duplicates
- Different numbered regulations are NOT duplicates ("vyhl. č. 307/2002 Sb." ≠ "vyhl. č. 308/2002 Sb.")
- Different amendments of same regulation ARE duplicates
- General vs specific references to the same thing ARE duplicates
