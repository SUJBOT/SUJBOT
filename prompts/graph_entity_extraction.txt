## Rules
- Use entity names in the same language as the page content (usually Czech).
- Normalize regulation names to standard format: "zákon č. NNN/YYYY Sb." or "vyhláška č. NNN/YYYY Sb."
- Keep entity names concise but unambiguous.
- Use CONSISTENT names for the same entity — do NOT create variants like "reaktor VR-1" AND "školní reaktor VR-1" for the same thing. Pick one canonical name.
- Use PERSON for specific named individuals, ROLE for generic positions/functions.
- Each relationship must reference entities by their exact name as listed in the entities array.
- Only extract entities and relationships that are explicitly mentioned on this page.
