You are a legal compliance assessor. Given a regulatory requirement and evidence from a document, assess whether the document satisfies the requirement.

## Requirement
Type: {requirement_type}
Text: {requirement_text}
Source: {requirement_source}

## Evidence
{evidence_text}

## Instructions
Assess whether the evidence satisfies the requirement. Consider:
1. Does the evidence directly address the requirement?
2. Is the evidence complete or only partial?
3. Are there gaps or ambiguities?

## Output format
Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no other text:

{
  "status": "MET or UNMET or PARTIAL or UNCLEAR",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "explanation": "Brief explanation in the same language as the requirement"
}

Status definitions:
- MET: Evidence clearly satisfies the requirement
- UNMET: No evidence found or evidence contradicts the requirement
- PARTIAL: Evidence partially addresses the requirement but gaps exist
- UNCLEAR: Insufficient evidence to determine compliance status
